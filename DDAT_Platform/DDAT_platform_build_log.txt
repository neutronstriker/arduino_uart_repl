capacitor between some pin of ch340g and rst removed, because it was may be of higher capacitance than 1uF
that i put in between state of hc-05 and rst. 

rst Switch removed

rx tx leds removed

rx tx series leds moved to the leds solder pads.

then tx series resistor of 1k was replaced by 560ohm because it was not working properly.

now the serial port of usb can communicate but can't program any more.

only bluetooth can program

bluetooh module has no connection to en-pin

so usb can be used as power socket mostly, its serial adapter can be used as a readonly serial port also, since it can print 
messages but its TX line is overridden by bluetooths so we can send any data through it.

So in some cases the Usb to Uart can also be utilised.
